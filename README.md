# [WIP] Kubernetes Operator for Database and User on RDS Postgres (Aurora)
This an operator to create databases and users on RDS Postgres. It is developed for AWS Aurora RDS with Postgres engine but it can support RDS Postgres too.

## Description
* This is written using [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder)
* Create databases on AWS Aurora Postgres instance
* Configure ReadWrite and ReadOnly roles for the database
* [WIP] Create users for the roles. These users can be used by an applicaion running on K8s container on AWS such as EKS.
* The user is authenticated using IAM authentication for RDS. See [IAM Database Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html).
* The container is recommended to use IRSA([IAM Roles for Service Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html))


## Assumption
* This operator doesn't deploy Aurora Postgres instance.
* It only create a database on the instance and configure Postgres roles that can be used by a app user.
* [WIP] controller for creating app users will be added. 
* The instance has to be deployed separately. An infrastructure as code (IaC) using Cloud Formation or Terraform is recommended.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.20.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/postgres-db-user:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/postgres-db-user:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```
